## About The Project

Visual Math AI  is an AI-powered math solver that allows users to draw mathematical expressions on a canvas and get instant solutions within the help of Gemini AI and integrates Gemini for solving expressions, which are then converted to LaTeX for make a draw become knownable to recognize so stackie can draw the mathematical problem & get to solve the problem just a second.

## Built With

- [React](https://react.dev/)
- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)
- [Gemini AI](https://aistudio.google.com)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)

cd Visual-Math-AI/frontend
```

2. Install dependecies
```sh
npm install
```

3.  Start the development server
```sh 
npm run dev
```

- Backend
1. Navigate to backend directory: 
```sh

```

4. Run the main.py file:
```sh
python main.py
```

# Usage

1. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5173/.
2. Draw a mathematical expression on the canvas.
3. Press run to get the solver and see the results on the canvas.
4. Press reload if you want to clear the canvas.
